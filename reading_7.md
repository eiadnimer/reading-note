# Programming with JavaScript
You have to ask yoursel a 3 Qs:
***1- What is a script and how do i create one?***
- A script is a series of orders that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
- to start writing a script, you need to know your goal to achieve it and do tasks in order to complete it.
**To start writing the script , you have to do:**
1- Define the goal .. the idea you need to do it 
2- Design  the script .. you have to split the goals to individual series
3- Code the step .. each step you need to write it in a programming language that the computer can understand it .
- u have to think like a computers, they follow series of instructions .
## There is tow types of Expressions :
1- Expressions that just assign avalue to a variable 
we have to give the variable a value to be useful
Ex. var color = 'beige';
2- Expressions thats you tow values or more to return a single value
Ex. var area = 3 * 2; 
## Operators
Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
- There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 
## Function
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
- When We create a function, we have to give it a name and write the statment inside curly braces .
