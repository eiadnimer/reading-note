-There is a three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement: 
1-HTML ONLY
2-HTML+CSS
3-HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT
-JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
-We can use documents and methods inside the lines of JavaScript
-the browser should check if the script element is working or not, after that he can continue
-JavaScript files are text files like HTML pages, but they have the js extension.
-A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.
-A statement is an individual instruction that the computer should follow.
-The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step.
