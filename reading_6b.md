# Computer Architecture and Logic
- the computer has to perform four different task:
1- take input 
2- storage information
3- processing
4- output the results
- *and thats what's makes the computer a computer .*
- by the 20th century, computers started using electrical components, there were larg and slow.
- Computers started out as a basic calculators, but now we can use them to tlak to each other and play games etc.
- **Types of inputs:**
1- mouse 
2- keyboard
3- microphone 
4- camera 
- **storage:**
All the inputs give the computer informations are stored in memory 
**Output**
the computer can display a text,photo,video or games ! 
## Binary and data 
- Computers works one one and zero *0101010*
- Normaly nobody now using the ones and zeros, but actually the computers use the ones and zeros inside the computer . 
- With one wire, we can represent a yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0 , This 1 or 0 called a **bit** . 
the **bit** is the smallest piece information that can the computer store . 
- Any numbers can represented with only ones and zeros .
- We can also represent the text,image or sound with a ones and zeros
